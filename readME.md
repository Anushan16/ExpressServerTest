A vanilla application created to test my learning in server side hosting, particularly with express.JS. Code is set to run in the root directory. BMI calculator used as the logic to ensure input and output functions as expected. End user is privy to js code as it is hosted on the server as opposed to the clients browser as in previous projects.
